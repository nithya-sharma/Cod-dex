# Terminal Adventure Game
## Introduction
Hey there! Welcome to my Terminal Adventure Game! Imagine waking up as a phoenix in a mystical forest, surrounded by towering trees and the early morning sun. That's where your adventure begins! Throughout the day, you'll make choices that shape your destiny, face challenges, and explore this magical realm.

## How it Works
So, here's the deal: I've created a Python script called terminal_game.py that guides players through this epic adventure. As you run the script, you'll be presented with different scenarios and choices to make. Your decisions influence your character's health points and the outcome of the adventure. It's like being the hero of your own story!

You'll start with morning choices, where you can fly to the forest, visit the village, or rest at the camp. Then, you'll face afternoon challenges like visiting a wishing well or exploring a healing waterfall. Finally, as night falls, you'll decide whether to return to your nest or embark on a new adventure.

## Conclusion
And that's it! Whether you emerge victorious or face challenges along the way, the Terminal Adventure Game offers an immersive and interactive experience. So, are you ready to spread your wings and embark on this thrilling journey? Let's dive in and see what adventures await us in this mystical forest!
